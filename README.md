# Perdue-Logistics-Data-Analysis
A Tableau analysis and visualization of Perdue Logistics's transportation data.

This Tableau analysis and visualization was used to analyze logistical data from Perdue's logistics department. Perdue was looking for a way to reduce their costs in relation to held time (when a truck is held at a delivery location for more than an hour). The purpose of this analysis was to find the answers to specific questions asked by Perdue.
